 ## Swift 3/4
 
 - In 2014 Apple blew away developers with a surprise announcement that a new programming language called Swift had been secretly under development for 4 years!
 
 - Since being announced Swift has been officially open sourced and has been ported to Linux. This is huge because it makes its use on servers possible.

 ## Playgrounds
 
 - Playgrounds is a simple 'Live Coding' environment. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
 
 - But Playgrounds are crash prone. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª (üí™üèª set the run option to manual).

 ### Markup in Playgrounds
 
 - You can view markdown (Apple calls it "markup") in Playgrounds using a special syntax. You can find the syntax [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/).
 
 - Toggle between rendering and raw markup using the menu item: `editor > show raw markup` or `editor > show rendered markup`

 ## Variables & Constants

 ## Types & Type Inference
 - Swift declares types *after* the name following a colon

 */

var address3: String // here we must give address3 a type because it has no value assigned

/*:
 #### Types
 - Types are always upper cased
 - Instances are always lower cased
 - There are Swift specific foundation types for Int, Double, String, Array, Dictionary, Set, etc.
 - Swift can also easily and seamlessly cast between Swift Foundation types and the older foundation classes we're used to in Objc.
 - Swift has a generic type like `id` called `Any`. (There is also `AnyObject` and the relationship between these has morphed in complex ways. Find info [here](https://medium.com/@mimicatcodes/any-vs-anyobject-in-swift-3-b1a8d3a02e00).
 - For types that are related either by subclassing or protocols you can cast using the **as** keyword. (I will not talk about failable casting here).

 ## Optionals
 - All variables/constants members in Swift must have a value at initialization unlike Objc

 Objc allows variables to be nil

 ## Why Optionals Need to be Unwrapped
 - Think of Optionals as a box, just like NSNumber in Objc.
 - You can't do very much with an NSNumber in Objc unless you call `intValue`\`integerValue` on it to get the underlying value. Optionals are the same. They can only be used for nil checking without **unwrapping** them.
 */

//opt1 += " extra stuff"

/*:
 ### Forced Unwrap
 - The simplest and most dangerous way to unwrap (unbox) an optional is called `forced unwrap`
 - Generally avoid this unless you are sure of what you're doing
 - It simply uses the bang `!` operator
 */

 - Optionals allow you to set any value to nil, including (wrapped) C Struct types, and Int values. Can you set integers to nil in Objc?
 */

// CGRect rect = nil; //Objc error in Objc because CGRect is a primitive type

/*:
 - You can force unwrap after checking for nil first. You will almost never want to do this.
 */

//: Notice `let` allows you to start as nil and then do an initial assignment
let n6:String?

/*:
 ### Optional Binding
 - Swift provides convenience syntax for binding an optional to a variable
 */

if let n6 = n6 {
  print(#line, n6) // prints YES
}

//: **Tip:** The constant we bind it to can be named anything, but always prefer to re-use the initial name when possible (this is the preferred style)

if let someConstant = n6 {
  print(#line, someConstant + " more stuff") // prints YES, notice I don't have to unwrap it using (!) inside the block.
}

//: guard lets you bind and handle the unwrapped optional outside the block! This is insanely powerful. üëçüèª

//: But notice guard doesn't let you fall through. So, use it for conditions that are failing. You can use guard for ordinary if checking too.

  fatalError()
}

/*:
 ## Casting & Optionals
 */

let anyString = "some string" as AnyObject // upcasting never fails
let downCastString = anyString as? String // downcasting can fail so it returns an optional

/*:
 ## Arrays
 - Similar to `NSArray`, and you can still use `NSArray` (prefer `Array`)
 - `NSArray` is heterogeneous, but you can limit it using generics.
 - `Array` is homogeneous by design, but can be made heterogeneous (you almost always want arrays to be homogeneous)

 `switch` much more powerful in Swift. Not just limited to integers
